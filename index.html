        With the traditional libraries, one has to physically make arrangements and go to a library to access books or other documents. There are no such physical restrictions in the case of digital libraries. One can access it from anywhere, even from the comfort of their homes! All that is required is a good Internet connection. That’s it!</p></div>
    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#FFB6C1; margin: 1.5cm; color: #E30B5C;"><center><h3>Multiple Access:</h3><br><p style="color:#AA336A;">
        One main problem in traditional libraries is the restriction in using the same resource by multiple people simultaneously. It is not a problem in the case of digital libraries. Several individuals and institutions can access the same resource at the same time. Mintbook is one such digital library where resources are available to universities, training centers, banking, and even schools. It has a variety of content that matches everybody’s choice.
    </p></center></div>
    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#F2D2BD;  margin: 1.5cm; color: #E30B5C;"><center><h3>Easy-to-Use:</h3><br><p style="color:#AA336A;">
        DLs are more comfortable to use as compared to physical libraries. All you have to do is search for the title or the author, and you’ll get your book in no time. You don’t have to go from shelf to shelf looking for a book. Moreover, their digital libraries are customizable. Such DLs can be easily customized with your business requirements by getting integrated with your setup.

            Physical books get damaged after being used and reused again. Their pages get torn, and print disappears with time. Thus, DLs have an advantageous position in this area. No matter how many times a resource is being accessed, it will not affect its condition. It remains preserved in its original form for a more extended period. However, it is still debatable whether DLs are the ultimate preservation solution for physical books.
        </p></center></div>
<div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#F2D2BD; margin: 1.5cm; color: #E30B5C;"><center><h3>Scope of Improvement:</h3><br></center><p style="color:#AA336A;">
    Digital Libraries have improved and advanced due to technological changes. In the future, too, we’ll see the improved version of these DLs. For instance, the quality of pictures might improve, removal of visible flaws like discoloration and stains.</p></div>
<div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:#FFB6C1; margin: 1.5cm; color: #E30B5C;"><center><h3>No Limitation of Space:</h3><br><p style="color:#AA336A;">
    The storage capacity of the traditional libraries is restricted due to the limited amount of physical space. On the other hand, there is no such limitation in the case of DLs. DLs can store thousands of resources without facing any difficulties because media storage is very affordable. Mintbook Digital Library has about 10 lakh content stored in more than ten regional languages!
